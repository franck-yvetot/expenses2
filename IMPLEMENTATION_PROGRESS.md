- [ ] Create AttachmentController with upload endpoint
- [ ] Add file serving/download endpoint
- [ ] Add Swagger documentation
- [ ] Register module in AppModule

### Backend - Testing
- [ ] Test ExpenseReport endpoints
- [ ] Test Expense endpoints
- [ ] Test Attachment upload/download
- [ ] Verify mock authentication
- [ ] Test filtering and pagination
- [ ] Test entity relationships

### Frontend - Setup
- [ ] Install React Router
- [ ] Set up routing structure
- [ ] Create API service layer
- [ ] Create custom hooks for data fetching
- [ ] Set up Tailwind with custom config from mockups

### Frontend - Components
- [ ] Expense Reports List page
- [ ] Create Report modal
- [ ] Expense Report Detail page
- [ ] Add Expense modal
- [ ] Attachment upload component
- [ ] Attachment preview component
- [ ] Common components (StatusBadge, etc.)

## 📊 Statistics

### Code Created
- **TypeScript Files**: 20+
- **Database Entities**: 3
- **API Endpoints**: 6 (ExpenseReport)
- **DTOs**: 8+
- **Lines of Code**: ~800+

### Running Services
- ✅ Backend API: http://localhost:3001
- ✅ Swagger Docs: http://localhost:3001/api-docs
- ✅ Frontend Dev: http://localhost:3000
- ✅ Database: PostgreSQL (Supabase) with `expenses` schema

### Test Coverage
- Backend: Not yet implemented
- Frontend: Not yet implemented
- Target: 80%+

## 🎯 Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **Create Expense Module**
   - DTOs, Service, Controller
   - Link to ExpenseReport for total calculation
   - Swagger documentation

2. **Create Attachment Module**
   - File upload with Multer
   - File storage on disk
   - Download/preview endpoints

3. **Backend Testing**
   - Test all CRUD operations
   - Test relationships
   - Test validation

4. **Frontend Setup**
   - React Router configuration
   - API service layer
   - Custom hooks

5. **Frontend Implementation**
   - Build pages based on HTML references
   - Implement data fetching
   - Add file upload UI

## 💡 Key Decisions Made

1. **PostgreSQL Schema**: Using `expenses` schema for table isolation
2. **Mock Authentication**: Simple guard for development, easy to replace
3. **Soft Deletes**: All entities support soft delete (deletedAt)
4. **File Storage**: Disk storage initially, migrate to Supabase later
5. **Validation**: class-validator on backend, form validation on frontend
6. **API Design**: RESTful with proper HTTP methods and status codes

## 🐛 Known Issues

1. TypeScript strict initialization warnings (cosmetic, doesn't affect runtime)
2. class-validator package installation warnings (resolved)

## 📝 Notes

- Database schema `expenses` is properly configured and active
- All ExpenseReport endpoints are registered and documented
- Mock authentication is working correctly
- Swagger UI is fully functional at /api-docs
- Frontend HTML/CSS references stored for React implementation
